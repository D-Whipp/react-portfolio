        <p>Hello my name is David Whipple</p>
        <p>
          I was first exposed to Programming in High School when I took a
          JavaScript course. Back then I had no clue what Computer Programming
          was. I was simply looking for an excuse to play on a computer. I knew
          JavaScript was something special after the first day. Like many
          others, I concluded I simply was not smart enough to become a
          Programmer. So I got a job as a chef at my small towns local gas
          station restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>I worked at that restaurant for years.</p>
        <p>
          One day I decided I needed to do something more with my life so I
          started looking into college. First I attended PIMA Medical
          Institute's Dental Assisting Program. I worked for a year as a Dental
          Assistant and concluded it wasn't for me. Not wanting to spend the
          better part of a decade as a Dental Assistant, as I did with my
          previous job, I went back to school.
        </p>
        <p>
          I attended my local community college. Where I earned an Associates in
          Applied Sciences. I got into the Nursing Program. I was proud of
          myself because getting into the program was'nt easy. Some people
          waited years to get in. And I managed to obtain a seat in two months.
          I worked hard for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once in I began to succeed. My wife, who is a nurse, would talk with
          me about the program. She had gone through it a few years prior.
          Bonding with her over our shared experiances was fun but ...I kept
          bringing up that old JavaScript course I took back in High School.
        </p>
        <p>
          Halfways through the Nursing Program I was struggling. Not with the
          clinical portion. Helping others was never a problem. I couldn't
          generate interst in the material. It quickly became apparent I was in
          the wrong career.
        </p>
        <p>
          My wife pointed out how much I enjoyed talking about the JavaScript
          course I took back in High School and she had the idea that maybe I
          should give Programming a try. So I did. I took a few courses on
          Udemy, Lynda.com, and after concluding how much I loved it I decided
          to attend a Coding Boot Camp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I am about to graduate the University of Arizona's FullStack
          Coding Bootcamp. I couldn't be happier. Soon I will read, study, and
          write Code for a living and I couldn't imagine a better world.
