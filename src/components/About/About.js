        <p>
          I'm a Front-End web developer. Recently earned a certificate in full
          stack development from the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, with
          newly developed skills in CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and responsive
          web design. A motivated problem solver with a passion to learn and
          practice everything programming related. Using my newly acquired
          skills I set out to fully understand my tasks and create an effective
          strategy which will allow me to complete my tasks to the best of my
          ability.
